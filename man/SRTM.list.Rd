SRTM data are distributed in two levels: SRTM1 (for the United States and its territories and possessions) with data sampled at 1 arc-second intervals in latitude and longitude (or 30 meters or 98 feet), and SRTM3 (for the world) sampled at 3 arc-seconds (or 90 meters or 295 feet). Three arc-second data are generated by three by three averaging of the one arc-second samples.

File names refer to the latitude and longitude of the lower left corner of the tile - e.g. N37W105 has its lower left corner at 37 degrees north latitude and 105 degrees west longitude. To be more exact, these coordinates refer to the geometric center of the lower left pixel. In addition, the files are separated by geographical zones, i.e., parent directory. For example, SRTM1 contains 7 zones, whereas SRTM3 divides the zones by continent.

SRTM3 files contain 1201 lines and 1201 samples. The rows at the north and south edges as well as the columns at the east and west edges of each cell overlap and are identical to the edge rows and columns in the adjacent cell. SRTM1 files contain 3601 lines and 3601 samples, with similar overlap.
